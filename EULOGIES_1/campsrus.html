		Let me set the mood for you. Summer of 2016: I was freshly out of high school. Hoorah! I am finally an adult! I wanted to make some coin before I start my first year of college. At the time, I was already in the interview process of a design job at a firm in Long Island. To my surprise, they were very interested in the work that I have accomplished. I was in contact with the head of the agency and he told me that I would be called in for a second interview in 2-3 weeks. 2 weeks come, no response. 3 weeks come, still no response. I'm getting nervous! I started looking at more jobs and a couple of my friends were recommending a counselor position at a Camps R Us! My experience at that camp was literally living hell. I was being paid $5 an hour to take care of hellish children. This experience humbled me though and I am stronger now because of it.
