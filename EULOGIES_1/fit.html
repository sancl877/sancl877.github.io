		For a long time before college applications, I accepted my fate to a SUNY/CUNY school. Being a NYS resident, it made the most sense financially. I refused to put any sort of burden on my family. When it came to applying to colleges, I, along with a few others in my high school, chose all art schools. I was dedicated to attending FIT. It’s funny because I forced myself to believe that was my “dream school” when in reality I wanted to attend a private institution such as Pratt and Parsons. I put so much effort into the damn application. I got in (and to all my other schools.) During the Parson’s acceptance week, I told my parents I wanted to visit the school one last time. When I left, they refused to have me go to FIT. Here I am now making this website.
