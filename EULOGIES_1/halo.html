		I was always a video game fanatic. You were a part of so many lives. You were something that I always observed growing up. My cousins and our friends would always gather to have tournaments for you. You became a culture in itself and I wanted in. As <a href="gamecube.html">GAMECUBE</a>and Wii started to become boring and obselete, I decided to take manners into my own hands. I sold most of my <a href="gamecube.html">GAMECUBE</a> games in order to get my own Xbox 360. Like my <a href="gamecube.html">GAMECUBE</a> and their games, you served as a way for me to escape reality and connect with people online.
		<br>
		<br>
		I never took a game so seriously. My CR ranking was literally a digital dick size. I spent so much time sniping heads and gunning down other Spartans to boost my ego.
		<br>
		<br>
		You also helped strengthen my relationship with my friend, Justin. He was in a very dark place at the time and utilized Halo as an outlet. You existed in so many different places, that whenever we were together you were always brought up.
		<br>
		<br>
		Thanks for the countless of hours I spent with you.
